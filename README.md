# Text Extraction using OpenCV and Tesseract engine.
- This was the project assigned to me on 1 month long internship. It was one part of the internship. 
- Before procedding pls download Tesseract-4.1.1 from any of the GitHub repo its available on many sites. 
- Its a basic text extraction. I have researched with different method of scaling and whats better in different conditions. 
- Some commands are commented, as it was a part of the testing. The uncommented one gave the best result. 
- But it varies with different conditions like lighting and some other factors. So feel free to explore it.
